                            ## Modern method

                            - create a personal brand (social media, blogging, meetups, etc.)
                            - publicly demonstrate skills (behance, Github, blogging)
                            - participate in public discussions (HackerNews, Reddit, Tavern)
                            - apply directly at companies where you build connections

                        ## Tips

                        1. When writing a resume, treat it like a website that needs to be SEOed. Use keywords, be clear about what you do, emphasize willingness to learn
                        2. Many companies look for "culture" fit, increasingly more important
                        3. Recruiters attend meetups, people that go to meetups work at companies that need people, let organizer know you're looking!
                        4. Ask others for advice. Every person gets their first, second, etc. job differently
                        5. Make sure you get a job you'll love!
